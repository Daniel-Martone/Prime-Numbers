# Prime Numbers
- Prints all the prime numbers
- You can set the starting number
- Its optmized 

# Optimization
- At line 5 (five). I set the number = number+2 because a even number can't be prime, so there's no need to check
- At line 7 (seven). The loop ends in an entire division of the number by 2 (number//2), because a number can't be divided by a value that bigger than its half
- At line 10 (ten). I break the loop if the number is prime, so if it isnt prime, it won't need to reach the end of the loop
